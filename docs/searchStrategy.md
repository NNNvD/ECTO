# Search strategy for building version 0.0 of the textbook
### Version 1.0.0


## 1\. Rationale for the Search Approach

This literature search aims to assemble a representative, interdisciplinary corpus of theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical works relevant to the creation and evaluation of scientific theories in psychology. This corpus will serve as the evidence base and initial content for developing the textbook and generating Delphi survey materials.

A systematic, transparent search strategy is used to:

- Prevents idiosyncratic or convenience selection of sources.  
- Aligns with open-science norms of reproducibility and traceability  
- Mirrors systematic review methodology adapted to conceptual domains.  
- Provides a defensible foundation for expert consensus rounds.

## 2\. Databases and Repositories

| Type | Database | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Psychological and Behavioral Science** | PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection | Comprehensive indexing of psychological theory and methodology journals. |
| **Philosophy and Epistemology** | PhilPapers | Coverage of philosophy of science, abduction, explanation, and model evaluation. |
| **Interdisciplinary / Quantitative** | Scopus | Broad reach across cognitive science, modeling, and computational disciplines. |
| **Pedagogy and Education** | ERIC | Identifies literature on teaching scientific reasoning, modeling, and theory. |
| **Open-Science and Preprints** | PsyArXiv, OSF Registries | Captures emerging theoretical works not yet published. |

Using multiple databases mitigates disciplinary bias and captures both conceptual and empirical traditions contributing to theory methodology.

## 3\. Search Terms and Syntax

Search strings combine conceptual clusters using Boolean operators:

("theory development" OR "theory construction" OR "theory formation" OR "theorizing")  
AND ("psychology" OR "psychological science" OR "behavioral science")  
OR ("scientific explanation" OR "abduction" OR "explanatory power" OR "theory choice")  
OR ("formal model\*" OR "computational model\*" OR "mathematical psychology")  
OR ("model evaluation" OR "model comparison" OR "model validation")  
OR ("theory education" OR "teaching theory" OR "theoretical reasoning" OR "research training")

Searches will be adapted to each database’s syntax. A search-log spreadsheet will record date, database, query string, number of hits, and filters applied.

**Rationale for term selection:**  
The terms reflect the main dimensions of the Delphi project:

- *Theory creation* → “theory development,” "theory construction", "theory formation", "theorizing", “abduction,” “scientific explanation.”  
- *Formalization* → “formal model,” computational model,” “mathematical psychology.”  
- *Evaluation* → “model evaluation, "explanatory power," “theory choice,” "model comparison," "model validation."  
- *Pedagogy* → “teaching theory,”  "theoretical reasoning," “research training.”

## 4\. Search Limits and Filters

- **Publication years:** 1950–present (to capture classical and modern eras).  
- **Languages:** English (primary teaching and consensus language).  
- **Document types:** Peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, books, preprints.  
- **Discipline filters:** Psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, and education.

## 5\. Screening and Selection Procedure

A two-stage screening procedure follows PRISMA recommendations:

### Stage 1 – Title/Abstract Screening

The PI screens all search results for potential relevance.

### Stage 2 – Full-Text Screening

Remaining items are assessed against inclusion/exclusion criteria (see below).

A PRISMA flow diagram will summarize the process from identification to inclusion.

## 6\. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

### Inclusion Criteria

| Criterion | Justification |
| :---- | :---- |
| Addresses *theory creation, specification, evaluation, or teaching* in psychology or related sciences. | Ensures conceptual relevance to theorizing practice. |
| Presents explicit *methodological, philosophical, or pedagogical* argumentation. | Focuses on conceptual tools required by theorists. |
| Published in a *credible scholarly outlet* (book, peer-reviewed, or recognized preprint). | Ensures academic quality. |
| Provides *generalizable insights* (not case-specific descriptions). | Necessary for textbook abstraction. |

### Exclusion Criteria

| Criterion | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- |
| Empirical papers or theoretical papers that contain no explication of theory development/assessment methodology | Outside the methodological synthesis scope. |
| Opinion pieces without methodological or philosophical grounding. | Lack conceptual rigor. |
| Non-English sources (unless identified as seminal by experts). | Practical translation constraint. |
| Redundant or derivative publications. | Avoids over-representation. |

## 7\. Data Extraction and Coding

For each included source, extract:

- **Bibliographic details** (APA 7th).  
- **Primary focus** (e.g., theory construction, model evaluation, pedagogy).  
- **Level of analysis** (conceptual, formal, meta-scientific).  
- **Relevance tags** to Delphi phases 1–6 (see Project Description*)*.

This yields an **annotated evidence map** feeding into the Version 0.0 outline.

---

## 8\. Quality Assurance and Transparency

- All search logs, inclusion/exclusion decisions, and coding spreadsheets will be openly shared on OSF.  
- Deviations from protocol will be documented in Project Description updates and the logbook.

## 9\. Expected Output

1. **Annotated Bibliography** (\~50 sources).  
2. **Evidence Map** linking topics to Delphi phases.  
3. **Summary Report** describing the search process

### 3.5.9 Phase-Linked Creation of Version 0.0

Each Version 0.0 phase is developed in preparation for the corresponding Delphi phase (see *Preregistration)*:

| Version 0.0 Phase | Inputs | Output |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0.1. Tasks | Evidence map on theorist roles/outputs | Tasks & Outputs List v0.0 (incl. delegation notes) |
| 0.2. Skills | Competency literature; pedagogy sources | Competency Matrix v0.0 (tasks × skills; teachability) |
| 0.3. Topics/ToC | Concept maps; dependency analyses | Table of Contents v0.0 (sections/chapters/LOs) |
| 0.4. Content | Canonical texts; worked examples | Chapter Outlines v0.0 (sections, readings, examples) |
| 0.5. Assignments | Assessment & pedagogy literature | Assignment Bank v0.0 (mapped to skills & chapters) |
| 0.6. Evaluation | Rubrics & validity frameworks | Evaluation Matrix & Rubrics v0.0 |

Outputs are versioned (v0.0-x → v0.1-x …) with changelogs that trace revisions to literature evidence and Delphi feedback.
