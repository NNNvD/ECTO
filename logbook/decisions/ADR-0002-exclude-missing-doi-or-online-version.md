## Context
Some papers in the Zotero library lacked a DOI or an accessible online version.

## Decision
Exclude papers that do not have a DOI or an online version.

## Rationale
Filling in missing DOI/online access data would require disproportionate effort relative to the expected value for identifying experts.

## Consequences
The corpus shrinks, but remaining papers are more reliably accessible for screening and follow-up.

## Alternatives considered
Attempted manual retrieval of missing DOIs or online versions for all papers.
