## Context
Initial plans included balancing experts by discipline and region.

## Decision
Do not balance experts by discipline or region; balance by gender only.

## Rationale
Regional balance is infeasible due to skewed availability, and discipline is difficult to define given cross-disciplinary training and appointments.

## Consequences
Expert selection prioritizes gender balance while acknowledging practical limits on regional and disciplinary diversity.

## Alternatives considered
Attempt to define discipline categories and enforce regional quotas.
