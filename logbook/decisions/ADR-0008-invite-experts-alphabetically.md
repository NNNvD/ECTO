## Context
With qualification scoring removed, the invitation sequence needed a fair and practical rule.

## Decision
Invite experts in alphabetical order by surname (excluding prefixes), while ensuring at least one-third of invitees are non-male.

## Rationale
Alphabetical ordering is simple and equitable, and a gender balance check helps avoid a men-only expert group.

## Consequences
Invitations proceed sequentially with a lightweight gender balance safeguard.

## Alternatives considered
Randomized selection without ordering rules.
