## Context
Expert attrition can reduce panel size and affect the validity and continuity of consensus rounds.

## Decision
Adopt explicit expert replacement thresholds:
- At the end of a phase, invite additional experts if the number of experts drops below 10.
- During a phase, invite additional experts if the number of experts drops below 6.

## Rationale
Clear thresholds make retention and replenishment decisions transparent and actionable, and help maintain an adequate expert panel throughout the project.

## Consequences
Project operations now include active monitoring of panel size during and between phases, with pre-defined triggers for additional invitations.

## Alternatives considered
Continue without explicit replacement thresholds and decide case by case.
