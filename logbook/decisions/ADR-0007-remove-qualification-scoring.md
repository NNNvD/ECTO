## Context
Expert Identification V1.0 included a Step 4 qualification scoring rubric and a ranked invitation list.

## Decision
Remove Step 4 qualification scoring and avoid ranking invitees. Collect self-assessments of substantive theory, methodological, and pedagogical expertise instead.

## Rationale
Scoring would be subjective and time-intensive, scholarly impact metrics do not map cleanly to project-relevant expertise, and availability cannot be assessed from public profiles.

## Consequences
Invitations proceed without a numeric ranking; expertise self-assessments are collected for context rather than inclusion/exclusion.

## Alternatives considered
Proceed with manual scoring and ranking despite subjectivity and measurement gaps.
