# 2026-02-02 — Meeting — General discussion on design

## Attendees
- Noah van Dongen
- Bodil Jorg

## Agenda
- Consensus rule

## Notes
- The cut-off of 25% might be a bit too strict. In her experience, expert groups can have occasional outliers that can create the appearance of disagreement, but this might be situational, temporary, or due to the voices of a few.
- She proposed changing the 25% to 30% in the consensus rule. I agreed with her reasoning.

## Decisions
- Replace 25% with 30% in the consensus rule: “Phase item-set achieves mean ≥ 4.5, no single item receives a score < 3.0 by more than 30% of the experts, and no new items are proposed in the final feedback round.”

## Actions
- Update Section 7. *Consensus Criteria and Stopping Rules* in the *Project Description* document.
