# 2026-01-15 — Meeting — General discussion on design

## Attendees
- Noah van Dongen
- Bodil Jorg

## Agenda
- General design of the project
- Consensus rule

## Notes
- The projects that Bodil Jorg works on typically only have 3 consensus rounds. We should pay close attention to attrition and participant fatigue.
- We should evaluate per run if we need to include more experts.
- Bodil thought the current inclusion criteria were inclusive enough to catch a diverse set of experts.
- We did not have time to discuss the consensus rule. This will be discussed during another meeting.

## Decisions
- At the end of a phase, we are going to invite more experts if the number of experts has dropped below 10.
- During a phase, we are going to invite more experts if the number of experts drops below 6.

## Actions
- Update Section 3.2 *Replacement and Retention* in the *Project Description* document.
