## Entries
### 16:00 — Screening — Initial pruning and inclusion pass
- Context: The initial corpus needed deduplication and exclusion of non-eligible items.
- What I did: Removed duplicates and excluded non-journal/preprint items or papers published before 2000. Excluded papers lacking abstracts or a DOI/online version. Screened abstracts for inclusion on theory development/evaluation/teaching relevance and extracted unique first/last authors.
- Result: 881 → 637 after deduplication; 567 after article/preprint + post-2000 filter; 564 after removing missing DOI/online version; 493 with abstracts; 107 included papers; 163 unique authors after deduplication.
