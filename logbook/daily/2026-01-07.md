## Highlights
- Reduced the corpus to 107 included papers and identified 163 unique authors.

## Entries
### 16:00 — Screening — Initial pruning and inclusion pass
**Context:** The initial corpus needed deduplication and exclusion of non-eligible items.

Today, I removed duplicates and items that met exclusion criteria (i.e., not journal articles or preprints, or published before 2000). Papers for which Zotero could not find an abstract were also excluded.

- **881** Initial publications 
- **637 **Publications after duplicate removal
- **567 **Publications that are journal articles and preprints published after 2000.
- **564 **papers after the removal of papers without DOI or an online version of the publication

Based on abstracts, papers were included (excluded) if they (did not) explicitly mentioned that the paper was about, in some shape or form, how to (partly or completely) create, develop, and evaluate scientific theories, or scientific explanations, or about teaching the necessary skills. Papers for which Zotero could not find abstracts for 71 papers, these were excluded. From the remaining 493 papers, 107 met the inclusion criteria. 

Extracting the first and last authors from these 107 and removing duplicates resulted in 163 unique authors of papers on the relevant topics.
