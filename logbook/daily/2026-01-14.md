## Highlights
- Used an ORCID-based script to classify author career stages, yielding 44 potential experts.

## Entries
### 14:00 — Expert identification — Career stage screening
**Context:** Needed to focus on assistant/associate/full professors and exclude trainees or emeriti.

A Python script was created to identify the ORCID IDs of the authors and extract their job titles from their profiles. This was done through the use of ORCID’s API. 

The script marked 5 authors for exclusion, 39 authors for inclusion, and 119 authors were left undecided. 6 additional authors were included after manual inspection of the output. 

It turned out that one person was listed twice, even after I thought I removed duplicates. This left me with 44 authors who might be identifiable as experts
