### 14:00 — Expert identification — Career stage screening
- Context: Needed to focus on assistant/associate/full professors and exclude trainees or emeriti.

- Result: Script marked 5 for exclusion, 39 for inclusion, and 119 as undecided; manual review added 6, and a duplicate removal yielded 44 possible experts.
