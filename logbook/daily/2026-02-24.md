## Highlights
- Updated the repo 
- fixed the Pages website
- made a first release to Zenodo

## Entries
### 17:00 — GitHub repo — General update and maintenance
**Context:** The GitHub repo was not set up properly yet, and the Pages website did not build properly.

I updated the documents based on the decisions that were previously made. I cleaned up the repo structure and removed redundant files. Once the pages build properly, I made the first release to Zenodo.
